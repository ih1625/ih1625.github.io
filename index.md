## Favorite CPSC 120 Lab


* Lab 6 part 1

  This lab was really interesting to me because it combines coding with a creative twist. I like the idea of building a program that can generate funny and unique sandwich orders based on user input. It's a practical exercise that demonstrates the power of programming in solving real-world problems, like streamlining ordering processes in restaurants or apps. It was really cool that we got to see at the end when the test were runned at the end which failed and whAT didn't 

* Lab 5 part 1

  This exercise provides a structured approach to practicing key programming elements such as defining functions, working with multiple files, and utilizing unit tests. Overall, it's a hands-on opportunity to reinforce fundamental programming concepts while gaining experience in a real-world coding scenario that I did enjoy even though I do not like math and was worried about that part. The math is what really worried because it is not my strong suit.
* Lab 7 Part 1 

  The exercise involved creating a program to ascertain whether street parking is allowed based on posted signs. I found this really fun not only because I kept having to go back and make sure the data I had was correct in the program from the rules provided. This gave me a little bit of an example of what I wanted to do as data analysis to make sure I have all the data correctly not only provided to me but as well, my program.
